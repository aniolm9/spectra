    /** @struct spectralOpts
     *  Struct with the options for the spectral estimators.
     *
     *  @var spectralOpts::fs
     *    Samplig frequency.
     *  @var spectralOpts::window
     *    Window type. See windows.h for the available types.
     *  @var spectralOpts::nperseg
     *    Length of each segment.
     *  @var spectralOpts::noverlap
     *    Number of points to overlap between segments.
     *  @var spectralOpts::nfft
     *    Length of the FFT used.
     *  @var spectralOpts::nframes
     *    Number of frames. It is automatically computed if new_spectral_opts_basic() is used.
     *  @var spectralOpts::isComplex
     *    Real or complex input sequence?
     *  @var spectralOpts::sides
     *    Sides of the FFT for real data (1 or 2). For complex data this parameter is not taken into account.
     *  @var spectralOpts::scaling
     *    Compute the PSD (V^2/Hz) or the spectrum (V^2) if data is measured in V and fs in Hz.
     *  @var spectralOpts::average
     *    Method to use when averaging periodograms (mean or median).
